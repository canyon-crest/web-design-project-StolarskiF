<p><img src="images/luxcity.jpeg" >I come from Europe. I was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mons,_Belgium" target="_blank">Mons, Belgium.</a> However, I come from Poland since my entire family is from there, I just was not born there. I lived there for about 7-8 years, moving houses once every 1-2 years, where we always lived somewhere on the countryside/in the suburbs, never in the city such as brussels. Moving frequently during my childhood caused challenges and brought benefits; such as difficulty of making long-term friends, though being able to improve at adapting to new environments. Afterwards, I moved to a neighboring country called Luxembourg. It is a small country, which you can drive across in under an hour for reference. <span class="highlight" >However, it is one of the richest countries in europe, ranking #1 in GDP per capita </span>, although it mostly appears underwhelming and boring. Thats where I lived until 3 years ago, where I moved to the U.S. with my family. Our nomad-like lifestyle continued here, changing homes once every year, ultimately ending up in Carmel Valley San Diego. </p>

<h3>Family</h3>
<p><img src="images/CCA.jpg" id="pic2" >I have 2 Brothers, one is 22 called Stan, the other is 14 called Jan. I live with my parents as well, my mother and my father. My oldest brother lives in Europe and goes to <a href= "https://www.uu.nl/en" target="_blank">University of Utrecht</a>  there. Hes enrolled in an honors program, where top-performing students help improve the state of their university. <span class="highlight" >He is the president of this program, a prestigious 1/1 position at the university. </span> My younger brother goes to CCA as well, and has just started out as a freshman. Our extended family still lives in Europe, such as my aunt and uncle who live in Luxembourg; where I moved from, although my grandparents still live in Poland, where we all come from. I also have a dog, she is a westie called Peppa, like from Peppa Pig.</p>

<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p><img src="images/Tennis_Racket_and_Balls.jpg" >I play sports such as <a href= "youtube" target="_blank"> Tennis</a>, Golf, and Basketball, although none competitively; just for fun. My favorite sport is Badminton, although I don't play it much anymore. <span class="highlight" >I used to play badminton in a club, and participated in some local tournaments, even winning a few. </span>However I fell out with the sport after moving to the U.S. I play games with my brothers and friends sometimes, such as chess or mobile games. However during my free time, I usually just spend time studying or sleeping, especially during stressful times like finals or midterm weeks. Possibly not considered a hobby, but I enjoy hanging out with friends as well. We play sports, go out to eat, and play games sometimes, especially with my european friends whom I cannot hangout with anymore.</p>
