<p><h2>Story of my Life</h2></p>

<h3>Locations of my life</h3>
<p><img src="images/luxcity.jpeg" >I come from Europe. I was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mons,_Belgium" target="_blank">Mons, Belgium.</a>  I lived there for about 7-8 years, moving houses once every 1-2 years, we always lived somewhere on the countryside/in the suburbs, never in the city such as brussels. Afterwards, I moved to a neighboring country called Luxembourg. It is a small country, which you can drive across in under an hour. However, it is one of the richest countries in europe, although mostly contains fields and villages. Thats where I lived until 3 years ago, where I moved to the U.S. I come from Poland since my entire family is from there, I just was not born there. </p>

<h3>Family</h3>
<p><img src="images/CCA.jpg" >I have 2 Brothers, one is 22 called Stan, the other is 14 called Jan. I live with my parents as well, my mother and my father. My oldest brother lives in Europe and goes to <a href= "https://www.uu.nl/en" target="_blank">University of Utrecht</a>  there, whilst my little brother goes to CCA as well. Our extended family still lives in Europe, such as my aunt and uncle who live in Luxembourg; where I moved from, although my grandparents still live in Poland, where we all come from. I also have a dog, she is a westie called Peppa, like from Peppa Pig.</p>

<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p><img src="images/Tennis_Racket_and_Balls.jpg" >I play sports such as Tennis, Golf, and Basketball, although none competitively; just for fun. My favorite sport is Badminton, although I don't play it much anymore. I play games with my brothers and friends sometimes, such as CoD. However during my free time, I usually just spend time studying or sleeping, especially during stressful times like finals or midterm weeks. Possibly not considered a hobby, but I enjoy hanging out with friends as well. We play sports, go out to eat, and play games sometimes, especially with my european friends whom I cannot hangout with anymore.</p>
